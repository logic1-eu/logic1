About
-----
This is the official documentation of Logic1, a Python package for interpreted
first-order logic. You find our source repository via the GitHub symbol at the
top of the page. Logic1 is currently a research prototype. We want to arrive at
a well-documented robust first distribution soon.

Description
-----------
First-order logic recursively builds terms from variables and a specified set of
function symbols with specified arities, which includes constant symbols with
arity zero. Next, atomic formulas are built from terms and a specified set of
relation symbols with specified arities. Finally, first-order formulas are
recursively built from atomic formulas and a fixed set of logical operators.

Logic1 focuses on interpreted first-order logic, where the above-mentioned
function and relation symbols have implicit semantics, which is not explicitly
expressed via axioms within the logical framework. Typical applications include
algebraic decision procedures and, more generally, quantifier elimination
procedures, including but not limited to the real numbers.

Examples
--------
Consider the real numbers with arithmetic, equations, and inequality. From a
formal perpective, this is the theory of real closed fields (RCF). Logic1 allows
to formalize the question for the existence of solutions of a parametric
quadratic equation:

>>> from logic1 import *                # import Logic1
>>> from logic1.theories.RCF import *   # import RCF
>>> VV.imp('a', 'b', 'c', 'x')          # declare variables
>>> phi = Ex(x, a*x**2 + b*x + c == 0)  # formalization with existential quantifier
>>> qe(phi)                             # quantifier elimination
Or(And(c == 0, b == 0, a == 0), And(b != 0, a == 0), And(a != 0, 4*a*c - b^2 <= 0))

Consider the infinite real sequence defined by :math:`x_{i+2} = |x_{i+1}| -
x_{i}`. Logic1 can check that this sequence has period 9 for all possible
choices of :math:`x_1`, :math:`x_2`. The final output :data:`T` is a constant
logical operator representing "True":

>>> from logic1 import *
>>> from logic1.theories.RCF import *
>>> VV.imp(*(f'x{i}' for i in range(1, 12)))
>>> phi = And(Or(x2 >= 0, x3 == x2 - x1, x2 < 0, x3 == - x2 - x1),
...           Or(x3 >= 0, x4 == x3 - x2, x3 < 0, x4 == - x3 - x2),
...           Or(x4 >= 0, x5 == x4 - x3, x4 < 0, x5 == - x4 - x3),
...           Or(x5 >= 0, x6 == x5 - x4, x5 < 0, x6 == - x5 - x4),
...           Or(x6 >= 0, x7 == x6 - x5, x6 < 0, x7 == - x6 - x5),
...           Or(x7 >= 0, x8 == x7 - x6, x7 < 0, x8 == - x7 - x6),
...           Or(x8 >= 0, x9 == x8 - x7, x8 < 0, x9 == - x8 - x7),
...           Or(x9 >= 0, x10 == x9 - x8, x9 < 0, x10 == - x9 - x8),
...           Or(x10 >= 0, x11 == x10 - x9, x10 < 0, x11 == - x10 - x9))
>>> p9 = Implies(phi, And(x1 == x10, x2 == x11)).all()  # universal quantifiers for all variables
>>> qe(p9, workers=4)                                   # use four processors in parallel
